<br><p><center><font size="10" color="green">AGRA</font><br>
<br><center><img src="C:\Users\Infinity Systems\Desktop\Images\Agra.jpg"><br>
<br><p><center><font size="5">
If there was just one symbol to represent all of India, it would be the Taj Mahal. <br>
The monument inspires millions of tourists to make the trip to Agra every year, waking up before dawn to see magnificent structure radiate at sunrise. <br>
But Agra tops the list of the best places to visit in India for reasons that go beyond India's most famous attraction.<br>
The city in Uttar Pradesh is chock-full of marvelous Mughal monuments, like Itimad-ud-Daulah's Tomb and Akbar's Mausoleum, decked out in hypnotic inlaid marble designs from top to bottom.<br>
Plus, tourists can also see another UNESCO World Heritage Site: the Agra Fort. <br>
With so many wonders in just one place, Agra is a must-visit city for tourists in India.
</font></p></center>

<br><p><center><font size="10" color="green">NEW DELHI</font><br>
<br><center><img src="C:\Users\Infinity Systems\Desktop\Images\New Delhi.jpg"><br>
<br><p><center><font size="5">
Despite its crowds and chaos, New Delhi offers tourists a lot to love. The colorful capital of India is the perfect marriage of heritage and modernity. <br>
Old Delhi contains some of the country's most treasured attractions, including the Jama Masjid, Red Fort, and Chandni Chowk shopping thoroughfare. <br>
But throughout the sprawling city, tourists can explore countless other sites of spiritual and cultural importance.<br>
Top tourist attractions in New Delhi include the Lotus Temple; India Gate; Humayun's Tomb; and India's tallest minaret, Qutub Minar. <br>
Fill your days exploring these mesmerizing sites, and refueling at street-side chai stalls and high-end restaurants.<br>

<br><p><center><font size="10" color="green">MUMBAI</font><br>
<br><center><img src="C:\Users\Infinity Systems\Desktop\Images\Mumbai.jpg"><br>
<br><p><center><font size="5">
Head to the energetic, coastal city of Mumbai—home to ultra-wealthy entrepreneurs and the Bollywood actors. Tourists are never far from five-star hotels or gourmet restaurants in this luxe city.<br> 
And even if those activities are out of budget, a cruise down the beloved Marine Drive will make you feel like royalty as you catch a glimpse of the scenic coast and glamorous Art Deco buildings.<br>
You can also see a more authentic, local side of Mumbai in the bustling "Thieves Market" or at the Churchgate railway station,<br>
where hundreds of thousands of homemade lunches are packed up for delivery to the city's office workers every day.<br>
Make sure you devote a day to checking out Sanjay Gandhi National Park and exploring the 2,000-year-old Kanheri Cave carvings.

<br><p><center><font size="10" color="green">RAJASTHAN</font><br>
<br><center><img src="C:\Users\Infinity Systems\Desktop\Images\Rajasthan.png"><br>
<br><p><center><font size="5">
Translated to "Land of Kings," Rajasthan brims with remnants of the kings and queens of past centuries. <br>
Between its glittering palaces, stately forts, and lively festivals, this western state deserves a starring role in your trip to India.<br>
<br>Jaipur, part of the Golden Triangle Tourist Circuit, which also includes Agra and New Delhi, is one of the top places to visit in Rajasthan.<br>
Dubbed "The Paris of India," it's known for its characteristic pink buildings, lavish City Palace, and jewelry stores galore.<br>
<br>The "Blue City," Jodhpur, offers tourists an equally unforgettable experience in its hilltop Mehrangarh Fort.<br>
Udaipur oozes romance with its flower-lined streets and fantastic City Palace Complex, where the royal family still lives today.<br>
And Jaisalmer looks like an Arabian Nights fairy tale brought to life, with its yellow sandstone structures and historic havelis (mansions).<br>
 No matter where you end up in this desert state, you'll be captivated by the magic of Rajasthan.

<br><p><center><font size="10" color="green">RISHIKESH</font><br>
<br><center><img src="C:\Users\Infinity Systems\Desktop\Images\Rishikesh.jpg"><br>
<br><p><center><font size="5">
Rishikesh has been on the radar for spiritually minded travelers since the late 1960s, <br>
when the Beatles spent time in Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram—now an abandoned site <br>
that has become an off-the-beaten-path tourist attraction for fans.<br>
<br>The town is nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas on the banks of the holy Ganges River, <br>
and serves as a center for yoga and pilgrimages. Take part in the action, or just enjoy the sounds of the temple bells<br>
 and sightseeing from Rishikesh's two suspension bridges, often guarded by assertive families of monkeys. Keep your distance.<br>
