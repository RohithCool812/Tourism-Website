Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago. Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, <br>
second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, <br>
evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language,<br>
had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India. <br>
The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. <br>
By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,<br>
and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.<br>
Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.<br>
Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women,<br>
 and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages<br>
 scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.
